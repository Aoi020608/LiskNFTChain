# Algorithms - Recursion

## Description

searching and

2 big problems

- hard to understand

-

1. Identify the base case
2. Identify the recursive case
3. Get closer and closer and return when needed. Usually you have 2 returns.

anytihng you do with a recursion can be done iteratively (loop)

depends on the situation

recursion is powerful technique

Proos
Dry
Readability

Cons
Large Stack

Recursion -> tree traversion

Tail Call Optimazation

## When should we use recursion?
- useful
- sorting
- every time we are using a tree or converting something into a tree, consider recursion.
- divide and conquer using recursion

1. Divided into a number of subproblems that are smaller instances of the same problem.
2. Each instance of the subproblem is identical in nature. 
3. The solutions of each subproblem can be combined to solve the problem at hand.
