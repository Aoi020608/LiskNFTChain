# Algorithms - Recursion

## Description

searching and

2 big problems

- hard to understand

-

1. Identify the base case
2. Identify the recursive case
3. Get closer and closer and return when needed. Usually you have 2 returns.

anytihng you do with a recursion can be done iteratively (loop)

depends on the situation

recursion is powerful technique

Proos
Dry
Readability

Cons
Large Stack

Recursion -> tree traversion

Tail Call Optimazation

## When should we use recursion?
- useful
- sorting
- every time we are using a tree or converting something into a tree, consider recursion.
- divide and conquer using recursion
