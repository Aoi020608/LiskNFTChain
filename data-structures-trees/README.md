# Data Structures - Trees

## Description
hierarchical structure

Documented Object Model

abstract syntax tree

1. Perfect Binary Tree
- efficient
- 

2. Full Binary Tree



Balanced Binary Search Tree
lookup O(logN)
insert O(logN)
delete O(logN)

Unbalances Binary Search Tree (worst case)
lookup O(n)
insert O(n)
delete O(n)




Google Search

preserve relationships

1. Pros
- Better than O(n)
- Ordered
- Flexible Size

2. Cons
- No O(1) operations


AVL tree

Red Black tree


Binary heap
less ordered
lookup O(N)
insert O(logN)
delete O(logN)

left to right insertion

Pros
Better than O(N)
Priority
Flexible size
Fast insert

Cons
Slow lookup
